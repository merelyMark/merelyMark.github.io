The top image is the F6 plane using the closest point method UFLIC with a 2048^3 grid size. I went ahead and did a GPUFLIC style LIC because I was having some bad aliasing issues with the way I wanted to do it. It may have been that I was doing a bad index lookup (which was a similar bug I found in the GPUFLIC style I wrote over the weekend), but it works and the results, although not shaded, are similar to the PacificVis paper image I re-generated at 2048^3 (the bottom image).

Currently, its very slow because I haven't got a GPUFLIC CUDA version up and running yet. I'm okay with not doing that.

I'm working on scaling now. It breaks at 4096^3 because of some memory issues, i.e. building the neighborhood lookup requires a bit of memory. Food for thought: the F6 dataset at 4096^3 generates 45M voxels. Further, a tree is constructed, which is another 53M array. A tree node needs to contain a pointer (size_t is 8 bytes) to the voxel array and whether it has children (8 bytes) and the children's offset (8 bytes). A voxel needs to know it's own morton code (8 bytes) plus it's closest point (3 x float) and an index to the triangle faces (8 bytes) to access velocity and normal arrays.

 So, in voxel information alone at 4096^3, that's 1GB of RAM.  For the tree, that's 848M of RAM. Plus to do the GPUFLIC, there needs to be a float array for the voxels, plus a "back" to ping-pong and finally another one to show with the raycaster, so that's another 135M. 
 
 Oh, and I just found a memory bug that was doubling the sizeof(cpm) + sizeof(morton) + sizeof(tri_index). Cool. Previous numbers reflect fix.
 
 To help save some memory, I also changed the push_back function from doubling to adding half the size. 
 
 Even still, I'm running out of RAM on the CPU (8GB). The neighborhood lookup array is 8 bytes of 14 * the length of the number of voxels. That's 5GB just for a neighborhood lookup. Good grief. I don't have enough RAM.
