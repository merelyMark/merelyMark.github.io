Start looking through the zfp code. Compact and well written. Intersperse the day
with training. Read the "Nebo" paper from Chris Earl. Get the Nebo code as well.

Chat with Peter about his new idea for encoding. Previously, the encoder built an 
unstructured tree. He has a new idea, and wanted to run past me how difficult it would 
be to parallelize.

Training, training, training.
