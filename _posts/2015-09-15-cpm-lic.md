![Closest Point Method LIC](/images/cpm-lic.png)
![Closest Point Embedding UFLIC](/images/uflic.png)

The top image is the F6 plane using the closest point method LIC. The bottom 
image is the same dataset, but using UFLIC with the closest point embedding. In 
both cases, I have turned off jitter and clamping to get a more similar looking image.

The UFLIC images is much smoother than the LIC image. This is why the jitter and 
clamping have such an adverse effect on the LIC image. 

So, I'm looking to smooth the LIC version using the CPM.
